A cultivation based magic system mod with high depth (eventually) and lore (doubly eventually).

This mod aims to give some sense of progression, mysticism, and choice paralysis that should pervade consumers of progression fantasy or cultivation fantasy. Each player has their own path, and so providing a more modular, dynamic magic system than has ever been seen before in minecraft modding history is the goal. I also aim to provide compatibility with several other magic mods such as botania, bewitchment, Amythyst Imbuement, and more via the pool system and allowing progression to make life easier with other mods as well. 

Inspired by (also doubles as a suggestion list!): The Cradle Series, Arcane Ascension, The Beginning After the End, Defiance of the Fall, Mark of the Fool, Dungeons and Dragons (mostly 5e), Mythology In General, Terraria, Apocalypse Cultivation, He Who Fights With Monsters, Stormweaver Series, Bastion, Savage Dominion, Skyrim, Divinity Original Sin 2, Divine Dungeon, Chaos Seeds, Every Goddamned Web Comic in Existence, and many more. 

VERY WIP, will probably be several months away from functionality, yet alone lore-completion.
