A cultivation based magic system mod with high depth (eventually) and lore (doubly eventually).

This mod aims to give some sense of progression, mysticism, and choice paralysis that should pervade consumers of progression fantasy or cultivation fantasy. Each player has their own path, and so providing a more modular, dynamic magic system than has ever been seen before in minecraft modding history is the goal. I also aim to provide compatibility with several other magic mods such as botania, bewitchment, Amythyst Imbuement, and more via the pool system and allowing progression to make life easier with other mods as well. 

VERY WIP, will probably be several months away from functionality.
